<h1>Cats of TikTok</h1>

    <p>By Sonja Ramseier and Chalid Baumann <br>
<br>
In short: <br>
During three hours spread across three days we screenshot cat videos on TikTok. Defined parameters ensure a representative result.
<br> <br>
Our goal:<br>
We will show a screenshot of ourselves whilst we are screenshotting the videos we are looking at and spending our time with. We have defined three categories to filter our screenshots and define and compare our personal taste regarding cats on TikTok. Due to the screenshots of ourselves during consumption, we stress the passive nature of consuming media on social networks.

<br>
In detail:
<br> <br>
We both like cats very much and are entertained by images and videos of them. Social media is a big and can be a very important part of our daily lives. With this project we want to find out and compare our taste in cat videos regarding the defined categories and emphasize the nature of consumption. We have chosen these three categories:
"Cats that creep me out" 
"cats I need to see when I'm having a bad day" 
"cats that I find beautiful"
We defined a duration of consumption to three hours in total. This period will allow a simple and guarantee a comprehensible overview. The idea is that we individually set our own search terms. All the screenshots will be taken by our phones.
The website is inspired by TikTok e.g. the grid. In order to see more information the viewer has to “swipe down”. First visible are the TikTok screenshots and by hovering the viewer will see the snapshot of us. With the collected data we want to create a collage with photoshop. We were inspired by Youtuber cyriak and his video “welcome to kitty city”. This kind of trashy collage style is exactly fitting to our vision of consumption on TikTok.
